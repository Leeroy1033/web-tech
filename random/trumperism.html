		<h3>Textual Facts</h3>
		<p>You’re disgusting.</p>

		<p>I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p>

		<p>You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</p>

		<p>Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes</p>

		<p>My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.</p>
